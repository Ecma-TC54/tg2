# TC54 Code of Conduct

## Introduction
Like the technical community as a whole, TC54 is made up of a mixture of professionals and volunteers from all over the 
world. To ensure a fair and balanced standards process, to avoid communication issues and unhappiness, and to promote 
inclusiveness, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to.

This isn’t an exhaustive list of things that you can’t do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it’s intended a guide 
to make it easier to enrich all of us and the technical communities in which we participate and empower others to speak.

This Code of Conduct is enforced within all spaces managed by TC54. This includes chat rooms and forums moderated by 
TC54, issue trackers on projects hosted by TC54, and TC54 events and meetings.

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing 
[tc54-conduct-reports@googlegroups.com](mailto:tc54-conduct-reports@googlegroups.com). 
For more details, please see our [Reporting Guidelines](#reporting-guidelines).

### Be respectful
Respect is a fundamental value of the standardization work. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is 
no excuse for poor behavior and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow
that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It’s important to remember that a community where people feel 
uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of the TC54 community should be respectful when dealing 
with other members as well as with people outside the TC54 community.

### Be friendly and patient
We understand that everyone has different levels of experience or knowledge in many diverse fields, be it technical or 
nontechnical in nature. We also have areas of knowledge we are eager to expand. We want to be a community where people 
can not only contribute, but feel comfortable to ask questions as well and learn along the way. When correcting another
participant, respond with patience and try to keep it polite and civil. Remember that we all were newbies at one point.

### Be inclusive
We strive to be a community that welcomes and supports people of all backgrounds and identities. This includes, but is 
not limited to, members of any race, ethnicity, culture, national origin, color, immigration status, social and economic 
class, educational level, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity and expression, age, size, family status, political 
belief, religion, and mental and physical ability.

### Be considerate
Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you make will 
affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions. Remember that 
we’re a world-wide community, so you might not be communicating in someone else’s primary language.

### Be careful in the words that you choose
We are a community of professionals, and we conduct ourselves professionally. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put 
down other participants. Harassment and other exclusionary behavior aren’t acceptable. This includes, but is not 
limited to:

* Violent threats or language directed against another person.
* Discriminatory jokes and language.
* Posting sexually explicit or violent material.
* Posting (or threatening to post) other people’s personally identifying information (“doxing”).
* Personal insults, especially those using racist or sexist terms.
* Unwelcome sexual attention.
* Advocating for, or encouraging, any of the above behavior.
* Repeated harassment of others. In general, if someone asks you to stop, then stop.

### When we disagree, try to understand why
Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time. It is important that we resolve disagreements and 
differing views constructively. Remember that we’re different. There is strength in having a varied community with 
people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to 
understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they’re wrong. Don’t forget that it is human to err and 
blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere. Instead, focus on helping to resolve issues and learning from mistakes.

## Reporting Guidelines

If you believe someone is violating the Code of Conduct, we ask that you report it by emailing 
[tc54-conduct-reports@googlegroups.com](mailto:tc54-conduct-reports@googlegroups.com). All reports will be kept 
confidential. Only the Chair and Vice-Chair, and possibly the Ecma ExeCom, will receive the reports. No identity will be 
made public before the individuals concerned have agreed to it.

If the act is ongoing, the Chair or Vice-Chair should take immediate measures to stop it if possible, and to gather the
information described below.

### Reporting Anonymously

If you do not feel comfortable sending your report to the reporting email address, then you may email the Chair and/or
Vice-Chair directly.

If that is not possible, we recommend creating a throwaway email account, and using that to send the report. This way, 
it is possible for the Chair and/or Vice-Chair to respond to you (to seek more information, for example).

In your report please include:

* Your contact info (so we can get in touch with you if we need to follow up).
* Names (real, nicknames, or pseudonyms) of any individuals involved. If there were other witnesses besides you, please try to include them as well.
* When and where the incident occurred. Please be as specific as possible.
* Your account of what occurred. If there is a publicly available record (e.g. project issue, forum post, or a public chat log) please include a link. Screenshots can be useful in the case something is edited or deleted before action is taken.
* Any extra context you believe existed for the incident.
* If you believe this incident is ongoing.
* Any other information you believe we should have.

### What happens after you file a report?
Reports will receive urgent and immediate attention. Please refer to the [Enforcement Manual](#enforcement-manual) for 
the complete information on how reports will be processed.

### Appealing
To appeal a decision, contact the [Ecma Secretariat](mailto:samina@ecma-international.org) which will transfer the 
matter to the Ecma ExeCom.

## Enforcement Manual
All responses to reports of conduct violations will be managed the Chair and Vice-Chair.

### Responses to Reports
When a report is sent, they will reply to the report to confirm receipt within 24 hours.

See the [Reporting Guidelines](#reporting-guidelines) for details of what reports should contain. If a report doesn't 
contain enough information, the Chair and Vice-Chair will strive to obtain all relevant data before acting.

The Chair and Vice-Chair will then review the incident and determine, to the best of their ability:

* What happened.
* Whether this event constitutes a Code of Conduct violation.
* Who, if anyone, was involved in the violation.
* Whether this is an ongoing situation.
* 
This information will be collected in writing, and whenever possible the deliberations will be recorded and retained 
(e.g. chat transcripts, email discussions, or recorded voice conversations).

The Chair and Vice-Chair should aim to have a resolution agreed very rapidly; if not agreed within a week, it will 
inform the parties of the planned date.

### Resolution
The Chair and Vice-Chair must agree on a resolution by consensus. If consensus cannot be reached, the matter will be 
turned over to the Ecma ExeCom for resolution.

Responses will be determined on the basis of the information gathered and of the potential consequences. It may 
include taking no further action, issuing a reprimand (private or public), asking for an apology (private or public), 
or contacting the company that the individual belongs to. It could even result in a temporary or permanent exclusion 
from some of the TC54 working spaces such as repositories, forums, or chat. For any contemplated action other than a 
reprimand or an apology, the Chair and/or Vice-Chair shall inform the Ecma ExeCom. Any exclusion needs to follow the 
process described in the Ecma bylaws.

Such actions taken will be reported as part of the TC54 report to the ExeCom.
