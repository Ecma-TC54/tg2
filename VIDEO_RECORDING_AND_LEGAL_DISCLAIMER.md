# TC54 video recording support and legal disclaimer

During the TC meeting, video recording (comment-by-comment and video recording captured by teleconference tool i.e. Zoom and TC54 participants) will be taken. The intention is to capture the various points of view of the committee members, which helps all members evolve proposals based on feedback received and understand the rationale of decisions taken.

TC54 participants are encouraged to edit written transcript for accuracy (where the goal is to accurately reflect the intention of the point being made, rather than word-for-word transcription), and to delete comments of theirs which they do not want to be recorded (e.g., due to risk of misunderstanding, inclusion of personal information, or any other reason). Edits may be made during the meeting by editing the Google Doc as it is composed.

If a participant makes a comment in the committee meeting and does not remove it from the notes, they are consenting for it to be published. A purpose of the transcription is not to collect or distribute personal information; if without consenting someoneâ€™s personal information is included in the transcript, the TC54 management will rectify or remove it upon request.
