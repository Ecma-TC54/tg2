## Notes

- The meeting is being recorded.  Our code of conduct applies to this meeting.  [https://github.com/Ecma-TC54/tg2/blob/main/CODE\_OF\_CONDUCT.md](https://github.com/Ecma-TC54/tg2/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).
- Intro by Philippe, preliminary matters, proposed agenda.
- Minutes from last meeting: approved.
- Summary
  - Philippe Ombredanne opened the meeting, confirming that Package-URL (PURL) is scheduled to become an official Ecma standard in December 2025.
  - Philippe also provided an update on the progress of VERS (Version Scheme), which has automated testing and existing implementations, aiming for an Ecma presentation in the spring. Steve Springett advised targeting mid-April to complete the VERS specification to allow for the 60-day patent review period before the June General Assembly (GA).
  - Michael Herzog, Philippe Ombredanne, and Steve Springett discussed the request to move PURL's JSON schema to version Draft 2020-12 and the need to better explain why a version is not required in PURL type definitions.
  - Philippe Ombredanne and Michael Herzog also discussed unique identification for test cases, the plan for PURL Release 1.0, including synchronizing documentation and using CalVer for type definitions, and Michael Herzog's overhaul of testing to introduce a new validation test type and separate "base" and "advanced" tests for conformance clarity.
- **Meeting Opening and Administration** Philippe Ombredanne welcomed everyone to the Ecma TC54-TG2 meeting, noting that Package-URL (PURL) is set to become an official Ecma standard later this month. He also reminded attendees of the code of conduct. The call minutes from the last meeting were reviewed and approved without objection (00:00:00).
- **Agenda and Status of VERS Standardization** The agenda included discussing the release of the PURL specification plan 1.0, PURL test updates, and PURL language library support progress. Steve Springett requested a status update on VERS (Version Scheme) (00:01:40). Philippe Ombredanne confirmed that VERS is at a stage where its repository has been refactored, a test suite is automated, and implementations exist in Java, Perl, Ruby, and Python. The goal is to seriously review the VERS specification in January, aiming for a presentation to Ecma in the spring for the June cycle (00:03:15).
- **Timeline for VERS Specification** Steve Springett advised targeting the middle of April to complete the VERS specification to allow enough time for the 60-day patent review period before the June General Assembly (GA) in Geneva (00:03:15). Philippe Ombredanne noted that VERS schemes, like PURL types, should not be included in the initial Ecma standard, as there are still many moving parts, and separating the principle and syntax of VERS from its scheme definitions is essential (00:05:58).
- **Discussion of JSON Schema Versioning** Michael Herzog mentioned a request to use JSON schema version Draft 2020-12 instead of Draft-07 for PURL (00:09:13). Philippe Ombredanne acknowledged that some communities, like the CEF community, require Draft 2020-12 features, but many tools still support only draft 07 (00:10:15). Steve Springett noted that the JSON schema working group is in the process of setting up an Ecma Technical Committee, and they are moving CycloneDX to JSON schema Draft 2020-12 due to some desired features and to ease the transition to an eventual Ecma standard (00:11:36).
- **PURL Version Requirement in Type Definitions** Michael Herzog raised the recurring issue of contributors wanting to require a version in PURL type definitions, which is currently not required due to the potential use of PURL without a version and VERS (00:06:58). He emphasized the need to better explain this to the community. Philippe Ombredanne mentioned responding to a similar pull request recently, where the submitter wished the version was required (00:08:10).
- **PURL Implementation and Test Suite Progress** Philippe Ombredanne provided an update on PURL implementation, highlighting significant work at AboutCode to implement support for the PURL test suite and update libraries to pass the tests (00:15:05). A need was identified to precisely identify test cases to allow for exceptions in implementations that are a work in progress, which could eventually become part of future Ecma standard editions (00:16:51).
- **Proposal for Unique Test Case Identification** Michael Herzog introduced issue 761 regarding the unique identification of test cases to help implementers specify which tests they are not yet passing. ([https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/issues/761](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/issues/761)) Philippe Ombredanne suggested that each test case could be a file, with the file path providing a unique identifier, although this would result in thousands of small JSON files (00:19:39). Michael Herzog agreed with using file paths for unique identification, particularly if separating base and advanced tests into directory structures (00:30:26).
- **PURL Release 1.0 Plan and Documentation** Michael Herzog updated the group on the plan for Release 1.0, which includes synchronizing the text under `docs/standard` ([https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/tree/main/docs/standard](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/tree/main/docs/standard)) with the actual Ecma 1st Edition text and creating an anchor point for future work. They have updated the `tests.md` overview file ([https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/main/docs/tests.md](https://github.com/package-url/purl-spec/blob/main/docs/tests.md)) to version 1.0, matching the current 0.1 schema, and made editorial changes. They plan to follow up with a collection of PURL type definitions using CalVer (calendar versioning) (00:23:02).
- **Website Update and Adopters** Michael Herzog reported that work on the website with John Horan is progressing, including separating specifications and tools into two different grids. OpenVEX has been added as a new adopter, but the main holdup is content creation and figuring out the impact of the CVE on the group's work (00:24:18) (00:44:13).
- **Testing Overhaul and Validation Type** Michael Herzog is leading a major overhaul of testing, summarized in issue 753, with several open questions. One topic is the naming of base/advanced test groups, possibly using "strict" and "permissive," though descriptions are considered more important than names (00:25:29). He proposed a new validation test type, which would return richer diagnostic messages (info, warning, error, success) rather than component data or strings, separating it from the existing parse and roundtrip types (00:26:26).
- **Conformance Requirements and Advanced Tests** Michael Herzog clarified that implementations would be required to pass the "base" tests for conformance (pass/fail) (00:27:58). Advanced tests of parse, build, or round trip types could correct things and provide informative messages, but the implementation would decide how to process the error messages (00:29:23). He emphasized the importance of making structural changes to the test suite now, such as separating base and advanced tests at the directory level, to improve clarity and adoption (00:30:26) (00:33:49).
- **Ecma General Assembly Timing** Philippe Ombredanne confirmed that the 130th General Assembly meeting of Ecma is scheduled for December 10th and 11th, where the PURL standard ratification will take place (00:45:11). Steve Springett confirmed their presentation of the Chair's report at the GA and noted that the TC54 plenary meeting planned for the same week's Thursday should not conflict (00:47:12).
- The meeting was adjourned.
