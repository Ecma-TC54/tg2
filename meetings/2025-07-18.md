## Notes
- The meeting is being recorded.  Our code of conduct applies to this meeting.  https://github.com/Ecma-TC54/tg2/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.
- Intro by Philippe, preliminary matters, proposed agenda.
- Minutes from last meeting: approved.
- In addition to the agenda topics above, attendees commented on additional topics they’d like to discuss today.
    - Michael: JSON Schema (PR 514)
    - Steve: timeline to review Ecma documentation; possibility of a working session to review Ecma docs – some corrections needed
    - Philippe: look at the refined schema PR
- Summary:
    - Philippe Ombredanne reminded participants of the call's code of conduct and Michael Herzog noted that summaries and recordings are available online.
    - Philippe Ombredanne then facilitated the approval of the previous meeting's minutes.
    - The primary discussion points revolved around the refined schema PR (PR 514), originally submitted by Steve Springett as PR 310, which aims to replace text-based definitions with JSON Schemas for defining package types and enhancing the test suite; and Michael Herzog emphasized the need to complete that PR so that it will be part of the v0.90 release. Steve Springett also raised concerns about normalization rules.
- **Meeting Logistics and Conduct** Philippe Ombredanne opened the meeting by reminding all participants that the call is subject to a code of conduct, which is available in the git repository for spec work (00:00:53). Michael Herzog added that the call summaries are posted online and recordings are available for reference (00:00:00).
- **Review and Approval of Previous Meeting Minutes** Philippe Ombredanne facilitated the approval of the previous meeting's minutes, sharing a link to the Google document used for the "running" notes in the chat. These notes are summarized by Google Gemini's speech-to-text transcription and carefully reviewed by a human intelligence (00:00:53).
- **Agenda Item Roll Call** Philippe Ombredanne conducted a roll call for agenda items. Michael Herzog proposed discussing the refined schema PR, specifically PR 514, to determine how to complete it. Steve Springett inquired about the timeline for reviewing the Ecma documentation and suggested a working session to go over the Ecma docs, noting that some corrections need to be made (00:02:27).
- **Refined Schema Pull Request Overview** Philippe Ombredanne presented an overview of the refined schema PR (PR 514), initiated by Steve Springett, which aims to replace text-based definitions with JSON Schemas for defining package types (00:03:50). This new approach would structure data fields like "namespace" requirements more clearly and extend the test suite with a schema for validation and organization into separate files per PURL type (00:05:33).
- **Test Suite Enhancements** Philippe Ombredanne explained that the enhanced test suite would introduce the concept of "test groups" to impact conformance, with "basic" tests indicating core spec conformance and "advanced" tests supporting additional features. This new structure aims to make tests more precise by explicitly defining inputs, expected outputs, and failure conditions, unlike the previous text blocks where the details were implied (00:13:52).
- **Normalization Rules and Conformance** Steve Springett raised concerns about the normalization rules, noting that their current textual format requires human intervention to write corner cases, which defeats automation for conformance (00:23:25). Philippe Ombredanne agreed to discuss this offline, suggesting that permitted character patterns defined in the schema via regex could form part of base conformance, while programmatic normalization rules might be considered advanced (00:24:56).
- **Project Timeline and First Release (Version 0.90)** Michael Herzog emphasized the urgency of completing the refined schema pull request (PR 514), considering it a gating item for the first (v0.90) release (00:30:19). The plan is to merge the PR and other housekeeping changes, including addressing spelling errors and structuring files to map to narrative sections of the spec, to complete version 0.90 by the end of the month (00:31:33) (00:50:10).
- **Document Structure and Schema Versioning** Michael Herzog suggested separating definitions (Section 6) and tests (Section 7) in the document, allowing schemas to be shipped as additional artifacts with the PDF version of the standard (00:32:23). Philippe Ombredanne confirmed that the current schema uses version 7 of the draft, which is widely used, and while switching to a newer version like 2020 is possible, one community member reported that Golang does not have good support for the newer version of the spec (00:33:11).
- **Project Management and Community Engagement** Michael Herzog outlined further project management steps, including restructuring meeting notes into a separate repository and adding contributing files (00:49:11). They also highlighted the need for a mailing list to facilitate broader community engagement and discussion beyond the core group, especially for those submitting PURL type requests (00:51:03).
- **Implementation and Communication Plan** Michael Herzog and Steve Springett discussed the plan to work with tool implementers over the next few months to ensure major implementations conform to the Ecma version of the standard (00:53:29). Michael Herzog also noted that a communications plan would be developed to reach out to organizations like SPDX and CSF to ensure they have ample time to review the initial release (00:55:27).
- The meeting was adjourned.
