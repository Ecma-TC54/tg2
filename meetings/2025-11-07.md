## Notes
- The meeting is being recorded.  Our code of conduct applies to this meeting.  https://github.com/Ecma-TC54/tg2/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md.
- Intro by Philippe, preliminary matters, proposed agenda.
- Minutes from last meeting: approved.
- Summary
  - Philippe Ombredanne opened the meeting with a review and approval of the previous meeting minutes without objection, and reminded attendees of the code of conduct.
  - Michael Herzog provided an Ecma update, noting the final stages of the Ecma standard-review process and the need to change the usage of "must" to "shall" for ISO standard preparation.  Michael also proposed a draft style guide using GB (Great Britain) English for documentation across PURL and VERS.
  - The main discussion focused on the organization and reevaluation of PURL testing, leading to a discussion about clarifying "roundtrip," "base," and "advanced" test groups, and introducing "validation" tests with severity levels (info, warning, error).
  - Matt Rutkowski raised questions regarding conformance alignment.
  - Philippe Ombredanne suggested that the roundtrip test type was a mistake and should be removed, and the group agreed to rethink the test suite structure to distinguish between base/conformance, permissive parsing/building, and validation features, with Michael Herzog planning to update the testing documentation with these categories.
- **Approval of Previous Meeting Minutes** Philippe Ombredanne opened the meeting and reminded attendees about the code of conduct policy and the recording of the session. The previous meeting minutes, which were available in the running notes and published on the TC54 repo, were considered approved as there were no objections (00:00:00).
- **Ecma Update and Standard Language Changes** Michael Herzog provided an Ecma update, stating they were in the final stages of the Ecma standard-review process, addressing editorial items. A key substantive change needed for preparation of the transition from Ecma to an ISO standard is changing the usage of "must" to "shall" in the specification. Michael Herzog explained that this change aligns with ISO rules for internationalization, where "must" refers to an external requirement and "shall" is internal to the standard, noting that this will be a global replacement (00:02:46).
- **Draft Style Guide for Documentation** Michael Herzog mentioned a draft PR for a style guide in the package-url/community repository (https://github.com/package-url/community/pull/10), drawing from Google and Microsoft writing guides (00:04:26). They proposed using GB English, where relevant, in general documentation, beyond just Ecma documents, to maintain consistency. This style guide is intended to apply to PURL and VERS, and optionally to other projects that wish to adopt it (00:05:35).
- **Organization and Reevaluation of PURL Testing** Michael Herzog introduced the topic of testing, noting that the current testing is "a bit of a mess" with substantial open PRs and issues related to testing and interpretation of the standard. A major deliverable is an update of the `tests.md` document, which is currently minimal and out of date (00:07:55). The discussion is centered on clarifying what constitutes "roundtrip," "base," and "advanced" test groups, as well as "parse" and "build" test types (00:09:21).
- **PURL Standard 2nd Edition and Schema Changes** Michael Herzog informed the group about the "PURL Standard 2nd Edition" project (https://github.com/orgs/package-url/projects/7/views/1), which tracks changes that affect the standard, with several open issues being schema changes, including adding a validation test type (00:09:21). They noted that changes to documentation could substantively affect the standard, requiring higher scrutiny. The core specification is considered section five of the Ecma standard, and inconsistencies have been identified between the standard and the "how to parse" and "how to build" documents, which are not officially part of the 1st edition standard but are substantive to the spec (00:10:54).
- **Defining Roundtrip Tests** The group discussed the roundtrip test type, which Philippe Ombredanne suggested was created as syntactic sugar for `parse` and `build` in sequence (00:13:16) (00:15:13). Matt Rutkowski questioned the audience and use case for roundtrip tests (00:14:20). Philippe Ombredanne acknowledged that it was likely a mistake to introduce the roundtrip test type as the input is intended to equal the output, suggesting a PR to remove it from testing (00:15:13).
- **Introduction of Validation Tests and Message Severity** The concept of validation tests was introduced, which would include messages of severity: info, warning, and error (00:15:13). Michael Herzog elaborated that an error would be a failure, while info and warning would handle lesser severities, such as syntactically correct qualifiers that are not registered values (00:16:22) (00:19:32). Matt Rutkowski questioned how the severity levels, especially "warning," align with the strict nature of standards and conformance, like in CycloneDX (00:17:37).
- **Distinction between Base (Conformance) and Advanced (Lenient/Tolerant) Testing** Michael Herzog and Philippe Ombredanne clarified that base tests are pass/fail against the standard, while advanced tests (also referred to as lenient or tolerant tests) are intended to help tools deal with things like non-registered but syntactically correct values (info) or cases like non-lowercased namespaces (warning) (00:17:37). They discussed whether validation test output should only provide a message or include a corrected output as well (00:22:19) (00:25:07).
- **Rethinking the Test Suite Structure** Philippe Ombredanne suggested rethinking the entire test suite, distinguishing between base tests, which should be the condition for conformance, and other types of tests (00:29:59). The group agreed to separate "validation" and "permissive parsing/building" as distinct concepts (00:40:48) (00:43:38). Conformance, permissive parsing and building, and validation were identified as three features that could classify tools (00:44:53).
- **Website Update** Michael Herzog provided an informational update on the website, mentioning that John Horan had updated the github.io site (https://package-url.github.io/packageurl.org/) to a new minimal site. The new site includes changes such as moving the PURL type grid and adding a prototype of the tools table to the homepage, although further work is needed on the tools grid and its modal (00:47:56).
- **Next Steps for Testing Documentation** Michael Herzog planned to update the testing documentation with the latest thinking on test categorization (conformance, permissive parsing, validation) for community review (00:46:41). They emphasized the importance of reaching out to specific community members, like Matt Donoughe, for input on the testing proposals due to their previous experience (00:49:00).
- The meeting was adjourned.
