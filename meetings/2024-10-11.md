  - PURLs are everywhere
  - Companies participating
  - Work on pending issues to drive review before spec
  - Progressing according to plan: spec to TC in Q1 2025
- Adam, Steve, Philippe discussed capitalization (or not) of the word “purl”.
  - Adam: for non-technical writing, we propose Package-URL and PURL.
  - Steve: in favor of this.  This group can lead the standardization of the name.
  - Decided: Package-URL and PURL
- John summarized his work reviewing the open issues and pull requests
  - As of mid-september (2024-09-20) there were
    - 98 open issues
    - 55 open PRs
  - Working document is a detailed Excel workbook with an issues sheet, PR sheet and several related summary sheets, e.g., labels sorted by frequency
  - 37 existing or proposed new labels
    - The two most frequently-occurring labels (issues and PRs combined) mention PURL types
      - Proposed new type (41 total)
      - PURL type definition (33 total)
    - Focusing on the top 12 most common labels, the topics they cover include the name, namespace, qualifiers and versions components
    - Broad range of other topics, from encoding and version ranges to test suites, documentation, spec release schedule and IANA registration
- Steve: perhaps a heat map of problematic issues/PRs; enrolled in GitHub beta to create tasks and sub-tasks, including issue type field: 3 types, plus labels as well
- Philippe: continue with labeling while deciding how we can enrich the data capture and analysis of the open issues and PRs
